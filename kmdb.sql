-- In this assignment, you'll be building the domain model, database 
-- structure, and data for "KMDB" (the Kellogg Movie Database).
-- The end product will be a report that prints the movies and the 
-- top-billed cast for each movie in the database.

-- Requirements/assumptions
--
-- - There will only be three movies in the database – the three films
--   that make up Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy
-- - Movie data includes the movie title, year released, MPAA rating,
--   and director
-- - A movie has a single director
-- - A person can be the director of and/or play a role in a movie
-- - Everything you need to do in this assignment is marked with TODO!

-- Rubric
-- 
-- There are three deliverables for this assignment, all delivered via
-- this file and submitted via GitHub and Canvas:
-- - A domain model, implemented via CREATE TABLE statements for each
--   model/table. Also, include DROP TABLE IF EXISTS statements for each
--   table, so that each run of this script starts with a blank database.
--   (10 points)
-- - Insertion of "Batman" sample data into tables (5 points)
-- - Selection of data, so that something similar to the following sample
--   "report" can be achieved (5 points)

-- Submission
-- 
-- - "Use this template" to create a brand-new "hw1" repository in your
--   personal GitHub account, e.g. https://github.com/<USERNAME>/hw1
-- - Do the assignment, committing and syncing often
-- - When done, commit and sync a final time, before submitting the GitHub
--   URL for the finished "hw1" repository as the "Website URL" for the 
--   Homework 1 assignment in Canvas

-- Successful sample output is as shown:

-- Turns column mode on but headers off
.mode column
.headers off

-- Drop existing tables, so you'll start fresh each time this script is run.
-- TODO!

-- Create new tables, according to your domain model
-- TODO!

-- Insert data into your database that reflects the sample data shown above
-- Use hard-coded foreign key IDs when necessary
-- TODO!

-- Prints a header for the movies output
.print "Movies"
.print "======"
.print ""

-- The SQL statement for the movies output
-- TODO!

-- Prints a header for the cast output
